      <dt><strong>Me</strong></dt>
      <dd>Hi, My name is Joshua Henry, I am Puerto Rican and was born on July 26th, 2008 in Bronx Lebanon Hospital.</dd>
      <dt><strong>My Highschool</strong></dt>
      <dd>I go to KIPP NYC COLLEGE Prep Highschool and am currently a Junior at this school. This School was actually responsible for introducing the program ALL STAR CODE and many other things that may help prepare for my goals in my Future</dd>
      <dt><strong>Sports</strong></dt>
      <dd>As a kid, I wasnt placed into many sports, I was more known as a kid who was more interested with subjects like legos and was more of an indoor kid and showed very small interest in sports. But as I continued to develop in age, I gained more and more interest in sports, the big 2 being Football and Basketball. I started playing Football and Basketball during my Middle School year and am currently still playing for my schools basketball team.</dd>
      <dt><strong>Hobbies/Likings</strong></dt>
      <dd>One of my biggest Hobbies, even to this day is traveling, whether it be out of state or even country. I have traveled to various locations such as Puerto Rico, Mexico, Spain and etc. I have a strong liking to getting out of state since I am so used to the bronx already. Something else I would like to mention is that I really love animals, specifically dogs, I myself own a labradoodle</dd>
      <p>This is all the interesting details I think are important about me!!!</p>
